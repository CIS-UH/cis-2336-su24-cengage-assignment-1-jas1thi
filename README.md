# Hands-On task1: Financial Planning Tips

## Project Description
In this project, you will use the `document.write()` method to create an ordered list of financial planning tips on a web page. The final result should match the image provided in Figure(attached on canvas).

## Instructions
1. Open the provided `task1_template.html` file in your code editor.
2. Enter your name and the current date in the comment section of the document's head.
3. Save the file as `task1.html`.
4. Within the `<article>` element, directly below the `<h2>` element, add the opening and closing `<script>` tags on separate lines.
5. Inside the `<script>` tags, add a JavaScript line comment with the text "create ordered list".
6. Below the line comment, use multiple `document.write()` statements to write the HTML code for an ordered list containing the following financial planning tips:
   - Reduce spending on non-necessities.
   - Use extra money to pay off debt, starting with highest-interest credit cards.
   - Continue paying off debts until you are debt-free.
   - Put a fixed percent of your pay aside every payday.
7. Save your changes and open `task1.html` in a web browser.
8. Verify that the content of the page resembles the image shown in Figure(attached on canvas)

## Submission
Once you have completed the project, submit your `task1.html` file for grading.

# Hands-On task2: Debugging Challenge

## Project Description
In this project, you will learn to locate and fix errors in HTML and JavaScript code. You have been provided with a web page containing several errors that need to be fixed. When all errors are corrected, the page should display the content shown in Figure(attached on canvas).

## Instructions
1. Open the provided `task2_template.html` file in your code editor.
2. Enter your name and the current date in the comment section of the document head.
3. Save the file as `task2.html`.
4. In the `<head>` section of the document, there is a `<script>` that declares and initializes the `reopenDate` variable. There are two errors in this code. Locate and fix both errors.
5. Scroll down to the `<script>` embedded within the `<article>` element. The code contains a total of four errors. Locate and fix all four errors.
6. Save your changes to the file.
7. Open `task2.html` in a web browser and verify that the page resembles the image shown in Figure(attached on canvas)

## Submission
Once you have completed the project and the web page displays correctly, submit your `task2.html` file for grading.
